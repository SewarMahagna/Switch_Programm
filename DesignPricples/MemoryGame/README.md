# Memory Game

## Description

The **Memory Game** is a simple card-matching game designed to test and improve your memory skills. Players flip over two cards at a time, trying to find pairs with matching values. The game continues until all pairs have been matched.

This implementation uses Python and showcases object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, with classes for the `Dealer`, `Board`, and `Card`.

- **Error Handling**: Ensures valid input and prevents illegal moves.
- **Randomized Cards**: The board is shuffled every time to keep the game unpredictable.
